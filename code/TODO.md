TODO: 

1. - Separate all the files into three different parts:
   - Preprocessing (preprocessing.py)
   - Model (model.py)
   - Train (train.py)
   - Inference (infer.py)

2. - Save all these guys in the code folder. (./code/infer.py, for example)
3. - Ruibo also made the candleization in dualgcn_keras.py, review that part of the code. 
4. - Check whether or not we need to use the .sh code from Alex's repo. 
5. - Ask for the new data (what does it mean to do the "sanity check"?)
6. - Check the new data available. Check it also with scp. 
7. - Review bibliography in case we want to use this model (or these ideas), in our future research endeavors. 

Finally, we need to check Ruibo's code from deepchem.
