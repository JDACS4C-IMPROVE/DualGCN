Notes on conda environment:

    1. Python version must be 3.6
    2. Must use pip to install tf and keras. Otherwise there will be version conflics. 
        conda create -n DualGCN36 python=3.6 tensorflow-gpu=1.13.1
        Will have conflicts when trying to install keras 2.1.4 
    3. newer versions of hickle is required. 
    4. mkdir ../checkpoint and ../log. These are required by the original code. 


Package install command lines:

conda create -n DualGCN36 python=3.6
pip install tensorflow==1.13.1 keras==2.1.4
pip install hickle (5.0.2) dill (0.3.4) scikit-learn pandas
pip install git+https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/candle_lib@develop


Above is a CPU version of TF. 
Or a GPU version: 
    1. Checked the version matched with tf-gpu 1.13.1, according to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
        cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.4
    2. However, cudnn=7.4 is not available now. cudnn=7.6.5 works.  

conda create -n DualGCN36GPU python=3.6
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1 keras==2.1.4
conda install -c anaconda cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.6.5
pip install git+https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/candle_lib@develop

The next line of code, we will need to run it (and force it) to load the h5 saved model from TF1. In case of NOT doing it,
we will receive a Traceback Error from python. 
pip install 'h5py==2.10.0' --force-reinstall\

mkdir ../checkpoint
mkdir ../log


NOTE: create a bash shell file that allows us to start the model, similar to Rohan's repo sh file.
