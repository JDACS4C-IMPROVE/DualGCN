Notes on conda environment:

    1. Python version must be 3.6
    2. Must use pip to install tf and keras. Otherwise there will be version conflics. 
        conda create -n DualGCN36 python=3.6 tensorflow-gpu=1.13.1
        Will have conflicts when trying to install keras 2.1.4 
    3. newer versions of hickle is required. 
    4. mkdir ../checkpoint and ../log. These are required by the original code. 


Package install command lines:

conda create -n DualGCN36 python=3.6
pip install tensorflow==1.13.1 keras==2.1.4
pip install hickle (5.0.2) dill (0.3.4) scikit-learn pandas
pip install git+https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/candle_lib@develop


Above is a CPU version of TF. 
Or a GPU version: 
    1. Checked the version matched with tf-gpu 1.13.1, according to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
        cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.4
    2. However, cudnn=7.4 is not available now. cudnn=7.6.5 works.  

conda create -n DualGCN36GPU python=3.6
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1 keras==2.1.4
conda install -c anaconda cudatoolkit=10.0 cudnn=7.6.5
pip install git+https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/candle_lib@develop

mkdir ../checkpoint
mkdir ../log
